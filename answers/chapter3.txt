1.prompt - asking for input 
2.asking for variable - cin >>
3.cout << "please enter variable";
cin >> number;
4.\n - newline, creates newline
5.whitespace - terminates input into string
6.any non-numeric symbol - terminates input into integer
7.cout << " hello, " << first_name << "!\n";
8.object - is real entity
9.literal - data, used to represent fixed values
10.int,char,float,string,bool
11.variable is a data type with an undefined value
12.char-1,int-4,double-8
13.bytes
14.= - gives value, == - checks equality
15.a set value to a data type
16.initializing - giving initial value, 
assigniment - assigning value
17.concatenation-combining strings ( x + y = z)=("a"+"b"="ab")
18.spaces,symbols,all caps are not ok in names
19.ALL CAPS, similalry named variables-x1,x2, names starting with _ 
are legal but not recomended.
20.all lowercase, simple short names, that can be understood by anyone
21.a program is typesafe , when all parts are used according to their type, 
otherwise hardware/software errors can occurs
22.conversion from double to int can be bad because double takes up more
space than int, that can cause memory errors
23.if the type x1 <= x2 requires an equal or less ammount of space than
the new one it is safe to convert
